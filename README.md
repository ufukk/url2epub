url2epub creates an epub file from a list of urls. It can most easily be used by pointing it to an index of articles; then it will find out the links, strip the article text from web pages -similar to readability- and join them in an epub file. 

Usage:

		url2epub https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/index.htm downloads/reform-or-revolution.epub

You can also use it with multiple urls.

		url2epub https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/ch01.htm https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/ch02.htm https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/ch03.htm downloads/reform-or-revolution.epub
